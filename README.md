## Awari
After reading the AlphaZero paper, the idea that the program learns only by selfplay 
is intresting, the only inputs needed are the game rules.

Trying to write a program that plays Awari.
Also trying to increase the reusablity of the code.
Monte-Carlo Tree Search is the best method for now.
